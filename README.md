# Voltage Controlled Switches ðŸ”Œ

This project investigates the behavior of real vs ideal electronic switches, with a focus on **MOSFET-based switch designs**. It includes simulations, physical testing, waveform analysis, and performance evaluation of two different switch configurations.

## Technologies & Tools Used

- **Analog Discovery 3 (AD3)**: Used for generating test signals, capturing waveforms, multimeter and oscilloscope for measurement/verification of ON/OFF behavior.
- **LTspice**: For simulating both switch designs.
- **nMOS and pMOS Transistors**: Used in complementary configurations for voltage-controlled switching.

## Features

- **Ideal vs. Non-Ideal Switch Behavior**:
  - Compared expected characteristics like zero resistance, infinite OFF resistance, and bidirectional current flow.
- **Real-World Testing**:
  - Verified ON resistance, OFF leakage current, voltage drops, and bidirectionality using real components.
- **Two Custom Switch Designs**:
  - **Switch 1**: Minimalist design using nMOS, pMOS, and a resistor.
  - **Switch 2**: More complex but efficient complementary configuration using voltage control.

## Test Objectives

1. **Measure ON State Resistance**: 
   - Using Ohmâ€™s Law and measured current/voltage drops.
2. **Measure Leakage in OFF State**:
   - With the switch open, detect any current that leaks through.
3. **Test Bidirectionality**:
   - Reverse terminals and compare performance.
4. **Verify Voltage Limits**:
   - Gradually increase supply voltage to detect any operational thresholds.

## Switch 1 Overview

- **Design**: Uses complementary nMOS and pMOS with minimal components.
- **Simulation & Physical Testing**: Performed in LTspice and on breadboard.
- **Performance**:
  - ON resistance: ~345â€“487Î©
  - OFF resistance: Up to 9.2MÎ©
  - Voltage drop in ON state: ~0.28V
  - Successful bidirectional operation
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Simple, low-noise design.
  - Limited by AD3â€™s 0â€“5V output range.
  - Best suited for low-cost, low-complexity applications.

## Switch 2 Overview

- **Design**: Enhanced voltage-controlled logic using two MOSFETs.
- **Performance**:
  - ON resistance: ~387â€“703Î©
  - OFF resistance: Over 11MÎ©
  - Cleaner control logic via VCONTROL pin.
  - Slight non-linearities between 1.5â€“2.5V due to MOSFET saturation.
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Slightly more complex and costly.
  - Outperforms BJTs in power efficiency and thermal stability.
  - Less suitable for mass production compared to simpler switch designs.
